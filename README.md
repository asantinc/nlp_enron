##Enron email search and analysis
To run Pagerank and Hubs and Authories on the emails:
```
python enron.py
```
This will overwrite existing scores for Pagerank, Hub and Authority in pr.txt, auth.txt and hubs.txt.

To print out a new graph displaying the key relationships set the variable `PRODUCE_GRAPH` in enron.py equal to True. 
However, this will require running the program on a computer that has graphviz installed.
